# StickQuest

I've been longing to create a game for ages to delve into modular and dynamic programming. It's an action-packed project still in development with modular and OOPs concepts. Just wrapped up the main character model in Blender and basic movement using root motion combat. However, combat is still a work in progress, with only one animation completed for a jab so far.As, My favorite games are Dark Souls and Elden Ring, and I've drawn inspiration for the basic movement mechanics from them.
